# eventBookingApplication
Main goal:
In order to enhance communication between an event-organizing company and its clients, I will be developing a robust REST API application. This application will serve as the backbone for smooth interactions, ensuring that information is exchanged efficiently and securely.

Key Technologies:
- Spring Boot: This is a powerful Java-based framework that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable web applications. It provides a solid foundation for creating the backend of our application.
- MySQL: I'll be using MySQL as the database management system. It's a reliable choice for storing and retrieving data efficiently. This ensures that all information related to events and clients is organized and easily accessible.
- Postman: This tool will be instrumental in testing and validating the functionalities of our REST API. It allows me to send various types of HTTP requests and inspect the responses, ensuring that everything operates as intended.
- React: For the frontend of the application, I'll be using React. It's a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, known for its reusability and performance. This will provide a modern and user-friendly interface for clients.

Development Process:
- Setting Up the Backend (Spring Boot and MySQL): I'll start by creating the backend using Spring Boot. This will include setting up the server, defining data models, and establishing a connection to the MySQL database.
- Database Design and Schema: I'll carefully design the database schema to ensure that it efficiently captures all relevant information about events and clients. This will form the foundation of our application.
- Implementing RESTful Endpoints: Using Spring Boot, I'll create RESTful endpoints that will handle various operations such as creating events, updating client information, and fetching event details.
- Testing with Postman: Before moving forward, I'll rigorously test the API using Postman. This will help identify and rectify any issues in the backend logic, ensuring that it performs reliably.
- Building the Frontend (React): Once the backend is in place, I'll shift my focus to the frontend using React. This will involve creating user interfaces for viewing events, updating client details, and facilitating communication.
- Integrating Backend with Frontend: I'll connect the frontend and backend to ensure seamless communication between the client-facing interface and the server. This integration is crucial for a cohesive user experience.

Benefits:
- Streamlined Communication: The application will provide a user-friendly interface for clients to interact with an event-organizing company, making communication quick and efficient.
- Data Organization: With MySQL as the database, all relevant information will be stored in a structured manner, ensuring easy retrieval and management.
- Rigorous Testing: The use of Postman for testing guarantees that the API functions as expected, minimizing the chances of errors or disruptions.
- Modern Interface: The React frontend will offer a contemporary and intuitive interface for clients, enhancing their overall experience.

# **SECOND PART:**
- Entities:
I'd start by creating Java classes to represent the entities, such as Event and Booking. These classes would have fields corresponding to the properties specified in the OpenAPI Specification, like id, name, date, and places for Event, and eventId, bookingId, and attendeeName for Booking.

- Repositories:
I would create Spring Data JPA repository interfaces for each entity, such as EventRepository and BookingRepository. These interfaces would extend JpaRepository to provide standard database operations like querying, saving, updating, and deleting records.

- Service Layer:
Next, I'd implement service classes (EventService and BookingService) to encapsulate business logic. These services would interact with the repositories to perform CRUD operations on entities.

- Controller Layer:
To handle HTTP requests, I'd create controllers (EventController and BookingController). These classes would be annotated with @RestController, and I'd define methods for each endpoint in the OpenAPI Specification. The controller methods would call the corresponding service methods.

- Request and Response DTOs:
If needed, I would define Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for request and response bodies. These DTOs help in transforming data between the client and the server.

- Exception Handling:
I'd implement exception handling to manage scenarios like bad requests (400), resource not found (404), etc. Spring's @ExceptionHandler would be useful for handling exceptions globally or on a per-controller basis.

- Security:
For security features, I might use Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization. For the "ADMIN ONLY" feature, role-based access control could be implemented.

- Documentation:
Consider adding API documentation using tools like **Swagger**. Integrating these tools would automatically generate and document the API.

- Dependency Management:
I'd use a build tool like Maven for dependency management. Dependencies such as Spring Boot Starter Web, Spring Data JPA, and others would be included based on project requirements.

- Configuration:
Configuration settings for application properties, database settings, and other parameters would be set up in alignment with Spring Boot conventions.
